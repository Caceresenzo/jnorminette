# JNorminette, a Java cheap implementation of the 42's norminette

## How its work?
It work by using a lot of regex and computation to try to reproduce the behavior and the detections of the official 42's norminette.

## What's has already been done ?
To see the progress of where the project is, see the [TODO.md](./TODO.md).

## Can I contribute ?
- Yes you can! But you should respect the current code format where everything should "take space" to let the code breath and make it easier for the next developper to read it.
- And you are not allow to include any library in the project (yet) I try to make this project as clean and portable as possible.
